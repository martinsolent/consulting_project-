The Computing Subject Group at [Southampton Solent University](https://www.solent.ac.uk/) runs an Industrial Consulting Project module, which is delivered to all our third-year students. These students will work in groups of five or six on a "real-world" project provided by a digital industry practitioner or company. The aim of this project is for the students to receive feedback on how they have worked together to solve the problem.

They will work through three sprints with set targets: Gathering Requirements, Proof of Concept, and MVP. At the Proof of Concept stage, they will need feedback from the project provider, and final feedback will be given at the MVP presentation at the end of Sprint 3.

We will be running this module in Semester 2, from January to May 2025, and will need projects ready to assign to students at the start of January 2025. The problems to solve will need to fall within the following areas/fields:

- Digital design (UI) & User Experience (UX)
- Web development - Front-end or backend or both
- Cybersecurity
- Data Analysis
- Software engineering
- Networking
- Anything under the umbrella of computing

### What do we need from the project giver?

1. A short write-up (one or two sides of A4 max.) of the problem including background/context and some pointers for getting started 
2. Create a 3 to 5-minute video setting out this problem for the students to watch
3. Then the problem giver will pop back halfway through the semester (beginning/mid-March 2025) to see how they getting on and offer some feedback or direction
4. Then the problem giver will be part of the panel when the students present their solution and will help in the assessment process (beginning of May 2025).
