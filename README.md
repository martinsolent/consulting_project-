The Computing Subject Group at [Solent University Southampton](https://www.solent.ac.uk/) has a brand new Industrial Consulting Project module which will be delivered to all our 3rd year students who will be working in groups of five or six to solve "real-world" problem given by an digital industry practitioner or company.

We will be running this module in Semester 2 February - May 2022 and we will need problems ready to give to students from 17/12/2021

**The problems to solve will need to fall in the area/fields:**

- Digital design (UI)
- User Experience (UX)
- Web development - Front-end or backend or both
- Cybersecurity
- Data Analysis
- Software engineering
- Networking
- Anything under the umbrella of computing

### What we need from the problem giver?

1. A short write-up (one or two sides of A4 max.) of the problem including background/context and some pointers for getting started 
2. Create a 3 to 5 minute video setting out this problem for the students to watch
3. Then the problem giver will pop back halfway through the semester (end of March 2022) to see how they getting on and offer some feedback or direction
4. Then the problem giver will be part of the panel when the students present their solution and will help in the assessment process (end of April 2021).
